From this map, we can see that people living in landed properties are generally the happiest, followed by condo owners, and finally HDB flat owners. This could be a good indication of the correlation between wealth and happiness. People living in private estates represent wealthier families and are actually happier than less well-off Singaporeans. However, the sample size is relatively small. While the data is interesting and supports the intuitive correlation between wealth and happiness, more investigation is needed. This is a good starting point in opening up a thesis for social research on wealth and happiness nonetheless.
